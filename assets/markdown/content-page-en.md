# About Me

I am a Master's student at the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Soochow University](https://iai.suda.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Professor Li Juntao](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (2021-2025) in 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I maintained a GPA within the top 5% of my department and received multiple honors including Outstanding Student Scholarships and the Outstanding Student Award. These achievements earned me direct admission to Soochow University's graduate program without entrance examinations. I was a member of the university's Algorithm Studio and Remote Sensing Laboratory, where I participated in or led various projects including "High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Classification," "Virtual Reality Digital Exhibition Hall," and "Substation Training Safety Monitoring and Assessment Platform." I successfully registered two computer software copyrights and secured one National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project.

Currently, my research focuses on <font color=#0077AA>Natural Language Processing</font>, particularly in accelerating inference and lightweight implementation of large language models. I also have interests in multimodality, long and short-term memory capabilities of large models, and voice cloning.
